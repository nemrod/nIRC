To compile for your system all you have to do is run qmake (using Qt5, if Qt4 is default on your system run qmake-qt5) to generate a Makefile from the nirc.pro file and then run make to compile using the generated Makefile. An executable called nirc that you can use to run the program will now be in the directory.

The program has only been tested on 64-bit Arch Linux.
